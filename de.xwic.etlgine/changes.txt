	  dimensions to be cleared from the source.

	- JdbcLoader completely implements batchSize for insert and update statements (can improve sql performance up to >100%!)
	  If no batchSize is set, [connection name].connection.batch_size is used from server.properties, batchSize between 20 and 50 seems to work good
