Change Notes
=============

2009-07-28 FLI
	- Added auto-create unmapped elements feature
	- Moved cube-clear back into preSourceProcessing event. The movement caused imports to fail as these determine the
	  dimensions to be cleared from the source.

	- JdbcLoader completely implements batchSize for insert and update statements (can improve sql performance up to >100%!)
	  If no batchSize is set, [connection name].connection.batch_size is used from server.properties, batchSize between 20 and 50 seems to work good

2009-07-15 jbornema
	- Little restructure in JDBCLoader
	- DefaultMonitor logging adjusted

2009-07-06 jbornema

	- Fixed JDBCLoader primary key usage when it is not exported
